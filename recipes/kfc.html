                <i>KFC: An Introduction to the KFC Recipe</i>
                <p>KFC has been serving its world-famous fried chicken since 1930 — and using the same 11 herbs and spices since 1939 when Colonel Sanders perfected his recipe. Everyone knows that the Colonel's herb and spice mix is top secret, but that won't stop us from trying to find out what's in it.
                <br><br>
                Kentucky Fried Chicken claims that the secret recipe is only known by a few people and is protected by intense security measures. The original handwritten recipe is securely kept inside a vault at KFC's headquarters in Louisville. Additionally, KFC employs various companies to contribute different ingredients to the recipe — so not even they could know the full recipe.</p>
